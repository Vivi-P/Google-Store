# Google-Store

Business Problem Analysis We will assist Google in determining which applications work best on their platform in order to increase user engagement. 
Google Play takes 30% - 40% of the amount people spend for applications or as in-app transactions. 
Google can incentivise third-party app producers to build more engaging apps and thus increase revenue by identifying which apps perform better on the platform and why

## Our Agenda 

We intend to develop a model that identifies the most critical input variables that result in more downloads, higher ratings, and which applications are more
likely to receive favorable or negative feedback. We will define user engagement using these measures.
